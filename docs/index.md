## 💡 Why Physical AI?

The next frontier in AI isn't just digital - it's **embodied**. 

- Robots operating in the real world face challenges that pure software systems don't
- Understanding physical constraints enables better algorithms
- Real-time systems require different thinking than offline computation
- The future of AI is **physical intelligence** - systems that act in the world

This textbook prepares you for that future.
